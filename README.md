Liri Node App: 

A language interpretation and recognition interface. It's a command line app that takes in arguements and 
returns the desired data. 

Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- Spotify API
- Concert (bands in town) API
- Movie API (OMDB)

4 functions of this app are: 

    - A concert function to find artists with upcoming concerts, spotify function to find songs/artist/album, 
    movie function to get movie info and a do-what-it-says function that reads a file, "random.txt" that has one of the previous
    functions named above in it as the command and the respective search term. 
    - The last function also logs each of the commands entered to a separate text file, "log.txt"
